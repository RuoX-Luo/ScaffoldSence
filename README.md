# ScaffoldSence
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) question-answering system built upon the current scaffolding engineering regulations and standards of the People's Republic of China. It integrates ChromaDB for vector retrieval and the DeepSeek API for generative responses, enabling accurate regulation-level querying and context-aware answers.
